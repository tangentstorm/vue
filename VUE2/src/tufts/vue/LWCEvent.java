/**

 * This is for events issued from within an LWComponent object
 * hierarchy.  Usually they are property change events, although in
 * some cases they are used for more general purpose signaling.

 * <p>In addition to the functionality of a
 * java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent, this event also tells you who the
 * change happened to (not always the same as the source: e.g.,
 * hierarchy events are usually sourced from the the parent), and in the
 * case of multiple components changing, can give you an entire list
 * of components who were part of a single change (especially useful
 * for hierarchy events, where issuing individual events would be
 * messy given that the event delivery hierarchy would be changing as
 * each subsequent event is issued).  LWCevent also differs from a
 * PropertyChangeEvent in that it does not include the NEW value,
 * as that can be obtained by asking the changed component to
 * tell us the current value, and because more often than not,
 * the listener already has code to pull that out anyway: it just
 * wants to know it's time to go ahead and do it's thing because
 * something important to it has changed.  As it is, it only contains
 * the oldValue field for the UndoManager.  (And LWComponents are not
 * supposed to fire an LWCEvent notification unless a value has
 * actually changed.)

 * <p>LWCevent is also used for special events placed into the
 * hierachy, such as as "user action completed" event, which can be
 * useful for signaling model listeners that if you've been waiting to
 * update yourself (usually for performance reasons), now is the time
 * to catch up.  E.g., the MapPanner doesn't bother to attempt
 * repainting until it sees this event.  In VUE, the UndoManager
 * singles these events for us, as it already has to have been
 * explicitly told when a user action has been completed in order to
 * know when to stop and collect a new aggregate undo action.
 
 * <p>It is also used in special cases to essentially issue a "repaint"
 * event to the GUI, although these are stop-gap cases that ultimately
 * would be better handled as a recognized property change.
